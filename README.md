# Binary-brains
HackNITR 4.0

This is the project which my team "Binary-brains" created for the hackathon HackNITR 4.0.

This is a career guidance website. It collects data given by people who select their role as 'Mentor' and the data is used to create real life roadmaps for users who sign in as 'Student'.
The mentor has to select his/her career field from the wide variety of career options that are given on the website, and then has to fill up the details that will be used to create roadmaps.

Also, we have included a chat bot that will assist the students to decide their career field, if they are ambiguous in choosing it.
